    <h2>Minecraft</h2>
    <p>Minecraft is a sandbox survival game developed by Markus Persson, a Swedish programmer who went on to found Mojang to continue development, before selling the 
        company to Microsoft, who owns the company to this day. The game was released in 2009, going through a variety of public alpha and 
        beta builds, before the first finished version was released in 2011.
        
        The game was fast growing, eventually becoming the best-selling game of all time. It was popular because of the sheer amount of control 
        it gave the player. It gives the player a series of tools, a dynamic and randomly generated world, and no end goal. It is the quintessential
         sandbox game. That's on top of the extremely recognizable art style, being made entirely out of blocks, with pixel art for textures.
        
        This was helped by the growth of YouTube happening in its parallel. They grew intertwined, with Minecraft lets-plays, skits, etc becoming 
        the most consistently viral videos. The bigger Minecraft got, the bigger YouTube got and vice-versa. This created an online subculture that 
        essentially defined the 2010s. Minecraft song parodies, Minecraft animations, and more. People created videos about videos about minecraft, 
        and entire careers were made off the ad revenue from them.
        
        The game is influential beyond belief, with the game being sold to Microsoft for a total of 1 billion dollars. The game is responsible for a 
        large portion of 2010s internet culture, as well as some real life culture, in both the first and second hand..</p>
