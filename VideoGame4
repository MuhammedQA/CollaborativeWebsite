    <p>Roblox is a 2006 sandbox game, although technically being a game engine and host. It gives players a series of tools for game development, as well as a place to host them. You can charge money for items within the game and gain real-life 
        money for those purchases. This gives younger children, who the game is targeted towards, a chance to earn money for their 
        hobbies, in a career normally reserved for adults with degrees and qualifications.
        
        The game's art style is extremely simplistic, with the characters being extremely recognizable. The art style allows almost 
        any computer to run the game, as well as develop for it. This allows for them to sweep in a larger user base, especially among 
        children who likely can't afford a powerful machine to run it. This also creates more brand recognition, which then goes to sweep
         more users in.
      
        Like Minecraft, it spawned a large amount of attention on YouTube, allowing for more diversity in the selection of videos on the platform. 
        This leads to a sort of intertwining of the two games,m with people sometimes confusing the two, as well as there being a massive overlap in 
        the culture of the fanbases, as well as the fanbases themselves. Despite the large portion of its fanbase being children, the game has recently 
        showed some popularity with adults, with one specific game, "Dress to Impress" being popular among teens and young adults.
             
        The game is influential alongside Minecraft, and gives the user a large amount of control that most games don't, with many people considering 
        it technically an engine. It's recognizable well past its release, and gives children an experience in game development.</p>
