    <h2>Final Fantasy 7</h2>
    <p>Final Fantasy 7 is a 1997 Japanese Roleplaying game developed by Square Enix (referred to as Square at the time of release). 
        It revolves around the character Cloud, as well as the eco-terrorist agency "Avalanche". The game has a variety of subjects, 
        with the most important ones being environmentalism and the perils of capitalism. The game demonstrates these with the characterizations 
        of the 2 antagonists, Sephiroth and Shinra Incorporated.
        
        Shinra is the stereotypical big bad company, with their main income being the draining of the literal lifeblood of the planet, called Mako, 
        for fuel. They make so much money, that they essentially own their country of origin, Midgar, the richest country on Gaia, their planet. 
        Because of this, most of the world they're in is run by Shinra. They even have their own military, going as far as conducting human experiments
         to create super-soldiers.
    
        
        Another subject of the game's story is memory, mainly memory loss. Neither Cloud nor Sephiroth can remember a large portion of their past,
         with both of their character arcs revolving around the discovery of who they are and were. They are essentially two sides of the exact same 
         coin. Cloud's discovery drives him to gain confidence in himself and a willingness for teamwork, while Sephiroth's drives him to insanity. 
         Sephiroth couldn't cope with his past, having been the product of a human experiment that technically wasn't even supposed to be alive. 
         This insanity drives him to attempt to destroy the whole world by summoning a meteor.
        
        
        His reasoning for the meteor was that he believed himself to be related, a son, of the planet, with humanity being a parasite on it. 
        He believed that if enough souls died and returned to gaia, he could merge himself with it and both return to earth himself, as well 
        as take control of it, becoming a god. However, one could argue that Sephiroth is a victim of Shinra, having been driven insane by both
         Shinra's false memories, as well as his true memories being of pain and suffering.
        
        The main, overarching theme of Final Fantasy 7 is the inherent cruelty of a monopolistic, hypercapitalist company. It argues 
        this through the characterization of Sephiroth as a victim of Shinra, and the violence that Shinra themselves commits upon the
         planet and its inhabitants. The themes still stay relevant today. With the line between private company and public government 
         being blurry as ever, as well as a dying planet, many people are turning to Final Fantasy 7 a place of solace, not out of escapism, 
         but out of control. You can become cloud and have an impact on a world in a similar position to ours. A small group in a harsh world
          fighting for good, and having it work. In the real world, people feel powerless. But in this fictional world, maybe we ourselves 
          can make radical change.</p>
