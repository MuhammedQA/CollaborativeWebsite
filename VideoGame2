    <h2>Jet Set Radio</h2>
    <p>Jet Set Radio: Future is a 2002 action game by Actionbit under Sega. It revolves around a roller-skating 
        gang in future Tokyo. You can tag walls, race other gangs, and fight police officers. It was for the original Xbox,
         as the dreamcast was already discontinued. It was published in a dual case, being sold with GT 2002, a racing simulator. 
         It has extensively stylistic cel-shaded graphics with a soundtrack produced by Hideki Naganuma.
        
        The game is a cult classic, with the spiritual successor, "Bomb Rush Cyberfunk", being released in 2023. 
        Its popularization was a result of its stylistic choices, feeling almost like a celebration of 2000s youth culture. 
        It pulled from a variety of 90s subcultures and styles such as ravers, nu-metal, and hip-hop to create what felt almost
         like a prediction of whats to come for the decade. The rebellious nature of the characters, being cop-hating anarchist 
         gang members, only served to fuel that feeling, with it creating a sort of modern punk.
        
        This was only further emphasized by the games soundtrack, being a combination of jungle, 
        hip-hop,, punk, and more. Naganuma, the game's composer sampled western 90s rock and metal extensively, being a fan of a variety 
        of western subcultures that at the time didn't have parallels in Japan. As a result, the values and attitude of that music was 
        carried over into the game
        
        The game was an amazing love letter to 90s music and culture, as well as a tone-setter for the 2000s. It took the values of 
        punk and applied them to Japanese ideals, as well as bringing them forward into Y2K and the future.</p>
